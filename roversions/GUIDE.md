# Guide to RBLXutil/roversions:
Essentially a navigation guide.

## How we organize the endpoint scripts:
We organize them into platform folders for e.g
MacOS is in `mac` and Windows is in `windows`,
but that is really self explanatory.

## How we organize the actual files:
`platformfoldername-endpoint.js`
for example, if you wanted the Windows Roblox's Deploy 
History endpoint, you could go to windows-deployhistory.js in
`roversions/windows/windows-deployhistory.js`.
